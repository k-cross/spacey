description: A process to update documentation for humans and agents
---

- Read through the project and understand recent changes, perhaps through revision history
- Make changes to the README.md files for humans to read
    - The root level should contain higher level summarization and onboarding steps like how to get dependencies
    - The subdirectories should contain more detailed information about that particular project but no onboarding information
- Make changes to the AGENTS.md files for AI agents
